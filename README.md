Earth focus part-2 scatter plot

Continent A  string like 'Europe' and the Continent is the same as Country.  "In the lessons when we parse the results it is either because the data has a string and we want a number or when the data is one timestamp and we want another.
A scatterplot is a chart best suited to plotting two numbers against each other so try Area versus Population". As quoted by a tutor on my course.  So I am demonstrating a correlation with population verses area, using a scatterplot.
